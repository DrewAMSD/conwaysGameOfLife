# Conway's Game of Life

There is a predetermined grid, and cells can either be in a state of alive or dead.

The game follows 4 simple rules regarding each cells 8 neighbouring cells:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
